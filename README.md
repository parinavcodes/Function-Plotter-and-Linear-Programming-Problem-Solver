# Function-Plotter-and-Linear-Programming-Problem-Solver
This application was developed on C++ and has two major components to it, Function plotter and a Linear Programming Problem Solver.<br/>
• The First branch has the ability to plot 2-D linear and quadratic functions on the xy-plane.<br/>
• The second delves into the domain of optimization of objective functions by solving linear equations by graphical methods and providing the solution set of the problem.
